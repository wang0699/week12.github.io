How i create my interactive gallery?
 I started with a simple page skeleton and div for the images to go into. I used modern flex techniques
 to make the gallery flow. In my code, I create strings to add to the page in the gallerys innerhtml.
 I used an array of strings and looped through them to add each dynamically.



The reason for my design choice?
To fit the images I made a simple design with child themed colors. I used the array and for loop
to easily add images and expand on my images later.



What challenges i faced during development ?

The hardest part was getting used to the new flex techniques and getting the images to flow properly



How i overcame the challanges ?
I studied and tested out many different designs.



What i learned by creating my interactive gallery?
I learned about arrays, for loops, flex design and basic animations
